# Presentation Overview

## Introduction by Andrea
Andrea will kick off the presentation by introducing the team and setting the stage for the presentation. She will also provide a brief summary of the topics covered in previous presentations and explain how today's discussion builds upon that knowledge. Andrea will emphasize the practicality of linear regression as a modeling method, which is the central theme of our presentation. She will delve into the predictive and inferential aspects of linear regression that make it intriguing.

## Advantages of Linear Regression by Tyler
Tyler will follow up by discussing the advantages of linear regression and what makes it a unique method for modeling data. He will briefly touch on the motivation behind our example but primarily focus on explaining why the results are interesting. Tyler will emphasize the significance of making inferences and highlight the explainability of linear regression, a feature that sets it apart from many popular machine learning models.

## Model Explanation by Felix
Felix will provide a detailed explanation of the model being used, with a focus on accuracy and practical applications. He will clarify what R-squared is and how it is used to evaluate our model. Felix will also discuss the identification of statistically significant predictors and how the model's outputs can be interpreted in more detail. Additionally, he will touch on some of the drawbacks of linear regression and suggest ways to improve model performance.

## Interactive Example by Solomon
Solomon will conclude the presentation with an interactive example of linear regression. He will engage the audience by collecting their shoe sizes and attempting to predict their heights using the model. Solomon will explain how to interpret the model's prediction output, including the difference between the actual prediction and the prediction interval. The goal of this section is to showcase linear regression in action and highlight its prediction capabilities, even in the face of the model's simplicity.
